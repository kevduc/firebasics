## 🎯 Goal of this project

### 🔥 Discover Firebase, including:

- Firebase tools command-line API
- Authentication, using Google Account for this app
- Cloud Firestore Database, setup, rules, data validation and security, read/write from the app
- Firebase Storage, setup, rules, data validation and security, read/write from the app
- Deployment, GitHub Actions for PR preview and deploying Live

### 🎨 Discover Material UI Components:

- Made use of Buttons, Cards, App bars, Text fields (with character limit), Progress indicators, Snackbars
- Used both CSS and JavaScript libraries for the best Design and UX (e.g. for button ripple effect or to trigger notifications)
- Used the MDC CSS theme variables so the UI design can adapt to any theme (Purple theme here)
